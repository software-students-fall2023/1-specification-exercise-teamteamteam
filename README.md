## Stakeholders

Stakeholder:Nadir Muhammad, a 21-year-old NYU junior who lives on campus.

Goals/Needs:
1. A dedicated platform for NYU students to report and search for lost items.
2. A feature to view the location where an item was found on a campus map.
3. A secure method to cmmunicate with the person who found the item or with
   campus safety.
4. Assurance that found items are safely stored with Campus Safety.

Frustrations:
1. Losing items on campus and not having a centralized system to report or search from.
2. Finding items and not knowing where to drop them off.
3. Lack of awareness about the Campus Safety's lost and found procedures.
4. A time consuming process to find a lost item because he or she doesn't know
   if the item is at campus safety or not.
5. Items that are found may not be reported due to the lack of a simple and centralized
   reporting system, leading to more items going unclaimed.
